	<h2>Fun facts:</h2>

	<ul class="list">
		<li>Before spending years working for architects, Jay had more than a decade of experience creating technical designs of buildings in college and as a hobby in high school.</li>
		<br>
		<li>During college, he didn't have enough money to travel abroad, so he instead biked across America, stealth-camping most of the way.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Jay was homeless for his first few months in San Francisco, even after he had an architecture job. He spent a lot of time camping in the Marin Headlands and occasionally staying at hostels.</li>
		<br>
		<li>For about 5 years, he has lived in a national park inside the city, within a short walk from one of the most beautiful beaches in America</li>
		<br>
		<li>He also lived in a sailboat in Berkeley. It was very small and lacked the basic amenities, but it was still a beautiful winter.</li>
		<br>
		<li>He spent a few months developings methods for creating ultralight modular roof gardens. Despite filing a patent application and building prototypes on a shipping container, his startup didn't take off. But it was worth it.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Recently, Jay traveled around the world for over a year, fulfilling a decade's worth of deferred dreams. Learn more about it <a href="./travel.html">here.</a></li>
